**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. For questions and community discussion, please create a discussion (https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest/discussions).

**To Reproduce**
If possible provide a simple code example, using data from the package itself, that reproduces the behavior. The code block below is a starting point. Issues without reproducible code that we can use to explore the problem are much more difficult to understand and debug and so are much less likely to be addressed quickly. Spending some time creating a reproducible example makes it easier for us to help.

```
# Load the modules
from deepforest import main
from deepforest import get_data
import os

# Use the latest release
m = main.deepforest()
m.use_release()

# Use package data for simple training example
m.config.train.csv_file = get_data("example.csv")
m.config.train.root_dir = os.path.dirname(get_data("example.csv"))
m.config.train.fast_dev_run = True
m.trainer.fit(m)
```

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS:
 - Python version and environment :

**Screenshots and Context**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. Please paste entire code instead of a snippet!
