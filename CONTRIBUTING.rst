Developer's Guide
=================

Depends on Python 3.5+

Getting started
---------------

1. Quickstart by forking the `main repository <https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest>`_

2. Clone your copy of the repository.

   - **Using ssh**:
   
     ``git clone git@github.com:[your user name]/DeepForest.git``

   - **Using https**:

     ``git clone https://github.com/[your user name]/DeepForest.git``

3. Link or point your cloned copy to the main repository. (I always
   name it upstream)

   ``git remote add upstream https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest.git``

4. Check or confirm your settings using ``git remote -v``

   .. code-block:: text

      origin git@github.com:[your user name]/DeepForest.git (fetch)
      origin git@github.com:[your user name]/DeepForest.git (push)
      upstream https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest.git (fetch)
      upstream https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest.git (push)

5. Install the package from the main directory.

Deepforest can be installed using either pip or conda.

**Install using Pip**

Installing with Pip uses `dev_requirements.txt <https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest/blob/main/dev_requirements.txt>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
   $ pip install . -U

**Install using Conda**

Installing with Conda uses `environment.yaml <https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest/blob/main/environment.yml>`_.

Conda-based installs can be slow. We recommend using
`mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html#quickstart>`_ to speed them up.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda create -n deepforest python=3
   $ conda activate deepforest
   $ pip install . -U

7. Check if the package was installed; please test using the `sample code <https://deepforest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_.

Testing
-------

Running tests locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install . --upgrade  # or python setup.py install
   $ pytest -v

Checking and fixing code style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using Yapf
""""""""""

We use `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ for code formatting and style checking.

The easiest way to make sure your code is formatted correctly is to integrate it into your editor.
See `EDITOR SUPPORT <https://github.com/google/yapf/blob/main/EDITOR%20SUPPORT.md>`_.

You can also run yapf from the command line to cleanup the style in your changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   yapf -i --recursive deepforest/ --style=.style.yapf

If the style tests fail on a pull request, running the above command is the easiest way to fix this.

Using pre-commit
""""""""""""""""

We configure all our checks using the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. To verify your code styling before committing, you should run ``pre-commit install`` to set up the hooks, followed by ``pre-commit run`` to execute them. This will apply the formatting rules specified in the .style.yapf file. For additional information, please refer to the `pre-commit documentation <https://pre-commit.com/index.html>`_.

Testing the Conda Deepforest Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use the `conda_recipe/meta.yaml` to make sure that the conda build can build the package.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd conda_recipe
   $ conda build conda_recipe/meta.yaml -c conda-forge -c defaults

Conda staged recipe update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update the Conda recipe after every release.

Clone the `Weecology staged recipes <https://github.com/weecology/staged-recipes>`_.
Checkout the deepforest branch, update the `deepforest/meta.yaml` with the new version and the sha256 values. Sha256 values are obtained from the source on `PYPI download files <https://pypi.org/project/deepforest/#files>`_ using the deepforest-{version-number}.tar.gz.

.. code-block:: jinja

   {% set version = "fill new" %}
   {% set sha256 = "fill new" %}



Documentation
-------------

We are using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ and `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ for the documentation.

Update Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation is automatically updated for changes in functions.
However, the documentation should be updated after the addition of new functions or modules.

Change to the docs directory and use ``sphinx-apidoc`` to update the doc's `source`. Exclude the tests and setup.py documentation.

Run

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-apidoc -f -o ./source ../ ../tests/* ../setup.py

The `source` is the destination folder for the source rst files. `../`
is the path to where the deepforest source code is located relative to
the doc directory.

Test documentation locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs  # Go to the docs directory and install the current changes.
   pip install ../ -U
   make clean  # Run
   make html  # Run

Create Release
--------------

Start
^^^^^

1. **Run the tests** â€“ seriously, run them now.
2. Ensure `HISTORY.rst` is up to date with all changes since the last release.
3. Use `bump-my-version show-bump` to determine the appropriate version bump.
4. Update the version for release: `bump-my-version bump [minor | patch | pre_l | pre_n]`.
5. Publish the release to PyPi and update the Conda package.
6. Post-release, update the version to the next development iteration:
   - Run `bump-my-version show-bump` to check the target version.
   - Then, execute `bump-my-version bump [minor | patch | pre_l | pre_n]`.

Note:
Do not commit the build directory after making html.

This version correctly follows reStructuredText (reST) conventions and includes code blocks, inline literals, and proper linking. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
