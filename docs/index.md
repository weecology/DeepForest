`DeepForest` is an open-source library providing tools for object detection and geospatial analysis in ecology, specifically for analyzing forest canopy data.

## Quick-start: detect tree crowns in seconds

Below is the shortest path from *zero* to predictions. Everything runs on a CPU-only laptop; a GPU just makes it faster.

```python
# Install once (uncomment if you have not installed DeepForest yet)
# !pip install deepforest

from deepforest import main, visualize
from importlib import resources
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1) Load a pretrained tree-crown detector (â‰ˆ200 MB download on first use)
model = main.deepforest()
model.use_release()  # or: model.load_model("weecology/deepforest-tree")

# 2) Grab a tiny demo image that ships with the package
sample_img = Path(resources.files("deepforest.data")) / "OSBS_029.png"

# 3) Predict crowns and visualise
crowns = model.predict_image(path=str(sample_img))
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))
_ = visualize.plot_predictions(image_path=str(sample_img), pred_df=crowns, ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

ðŸ‘‰ The code above downloads a single pretrained model the first time it is run and caches it locally for future sessions.
