# Prebuilt models

DeepForest has two prebuilt models: Bird Detection and Tree Crown Detection.

## Tree Crown Detection

The model was initially described in [Remote Sensing](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/11/1309) on a single site. The prebuilt model uses a semi-supervised approach in which millions of moderate quality annotations are generated using a LiDAR unsupervised tree detection algorithm, followed by hand-annotations of RGB imagery from select sites. Comparisons among geographic sites were added to [Ecological Informatics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157495412030011X). The model was further improved, and the Python package was released in [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13472).

## Bird Detection

The model was initially described in [Ecological Applications](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2694). From the abstract

>
 Using over 250,000 annotations from 13 projects from around the world, we develop a general bird detection model that achieves over 65% recall and 50% precision on novel aerial data without any local training despite differences in species, habitat, and imaging methodology. Fine-tuning this model with only 1000 local annotations increases these values to an average of 84% recall and 69% precision by building on the general features learned from other data sources.

We have created a [GPU colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e9_pZM0n_v3MkZpSjVRjm55-LuCE2IYE?usp=sharing
) to demonstrate the workflow for using the bird model.

## Crop Classifiers

### Alive/Dead trees
To provide a simple filter for trees that appear dead in the RGB data we collected 6,342 image crops from the prediction landscape, as well as other NEON sites, and hand annotated them as either alive or dead. We finetuned a resnet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet to classify alive or dead trees before passing them to the species classification model. The model was trained with an ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 128 for 40 epochs, and was evaluated on a randomly held out of 10% of the crops. The evaluation accuracy of the alive-dead model was 95.8% (Table S1).

Table S1 Confusion matrix for the Alive/Dead model in Weinstein et al. 2023

        |        Predicted | Alive | Dead |
        |-----------------|-------|------|
        | Observed        | 527   | 9    |
        |                 | 10    | 89   |

* Note *, due to the smaller training sizes, the confidence scores are overfit and not smooth. We do not recommend using the confidence scores from this model until it is trained on more diverse data.

## Livestock Detectors

This model has a single label 'cattle' trained on drone imagery of cows, sheep and other large mammals in agricultural settings. The model was trained on data from [insert countries and other metadata about landscapes].

## Want more pretrained models?

Please consider contributing your data to open source repositories, such as zenodo or lila.science. The more data we gather, the more we can combine the annotation and data collection efforts of hundreds of researchers to built models available to everyone. We welcome suggestions on what models and data are most urgently [needed](https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest/discussions).
