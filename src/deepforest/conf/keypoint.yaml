# Config file for DeepForest keypoint detection tasks

# Ensure we inherit from default config + overlay these overrides.
defaults:
  - config
  - _self_

# Task and Model Architecture
task: 'keypoint'
architecture: 'DeformableDetr'

# Keypoint-specific parameters for Deformable DETR
# point_cost: Relative weight of point distance in matching cost (default: 5.0)
# point_loss_coefficient: Weight of point loss in total loss (default: 5.0)
# point_loss_type: Type of loss for coordinates - "l1" (default) or "mse"
point_cost: 5.0
point_loss_coefficient: 5.0
point_loss_type: 'l1'

# For keypoint detection, start from pretrained Deformable DETR backbone
model:
    name: 'SenseTime/deformable-detr'
    revision: 'main'

# Transformer-based models often prefer lower learning rates
train:
    lr: 0.0001

# Pixel distance threshold for keypoint matching (instead of IoU for boxes)
# A prediction is considered correct if within this many pixels of ground truth
validation:
    pixel_distance_threshold: 10.0
