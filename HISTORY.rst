Version 1.4.1 (Date: Oct 26, 2024)
----------------------------------

- **Enhancement:** Use GitHub Actions to publish the package.

Version 1.4.0 (Date: Oct 9, 2024)
---------------------------------

 The major innovations are

1. New model loading framework using HuggingFace. DeepForest models are now available on https://huggingface.co/weecology. The models can be loaded using load_model() and used for inference.
2. An all purpose read_file method is introduced to read annotations from various formats including CSV, JSON, and Pascal VOC.
3. The CropModel class is introduced to classify detected objects using a trained classification model. Use when a multi-class DeepForest model is not sufficiently flexible, such as when new data sources are used for fine-grained classification and class imbalance.
4. deepforest.visualize.plot_results is now the primary method for visualizing predictions. The function is more flexible and allows for customizing the plot using supervision package. 

Additional features and enhancements include:

- **New Feature:** A crop_raster function is introduced to crop a raster image using a bounding box.
- **New Feature:** Added beta support for multiple annotation types including point, box, and polygon.
- **New Feature:** Added support for learning rates scheduling using the ``torch.optim.lr_scheduler`` module. The learning rate scheduler can be specified in the configuration file.
- **New Utility:** Created ``utilities.download_ArcGIS_REST`` function to download tiles from the ArcGIS REST API (e.g., NAIP imagery).

- **Enhancement:** The training module better matches torchvision negative anchors format for empty frames.

- **Deprecation:** ``shapefile_to_annotations`` in ``deepforest/utilities.py`` is deprecated in favor of the more general ``read_file`` method.
- **Deprecation:** ``predict`` in ``deepforest/main.py``. The ``return_plot`` argument is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0. Use ``visualize.plot_results`` instead.
- **Deprecation:** ``predict_tile`` in ``deepforest/main.py``. Deprecated arguments ``return_plot``, ``color``, and ``thickness`` will be removed in version 2.0.
- **Deprecation:** ``crop_function`` in ``deepforest/preprocess.py``. The ``base_dir`` argument is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0. Use ``save_dir`` instead.
- **Deprecation:** The deepforest.visualize. ``IoU_Callback`` for better alignment with the PyTorch Lightning API (see `issue <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/issues/19101>`_).
- **Deprecation:** ``deepforest.main.use_release`` and ``deepforest.main.use_bird_release`` are deprecated in favor of the new model loading framework, for example using deepforest.main.load_model("weecology/deepforest-bird").

Version 1.3.3 (Date: Mar 12, 2024)
----------------------------------

- **Enhancement:** ``split_raster`` now allows ``annotations_file`` to be ``None``, enabling flexibility during data preprocessing.

Version 1.3.0 (Date: Dec 3, 2023)
----------------------------------

- **Deprecation:** Removed ``IoU_Callback`` for better alignment with the PyTorch Lightning API (see `issue <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/issues/19101>`_).
- **Refactor:** Evaluation code now leverages the PyTorch Lightning evaluation loop for result calculation during training.
- **Refactor:** Simplified ``image_callbacks`` by using predictions directly. No need to specify the root directory or CSV file, as the evaluation file is assumed.

Version 1.1.3 (Date: Nov 9, 2021)
----------------------------------

- **Enhancement:** Added box coordinates to the evaluation results frame for better result tracking.

Version 1.1.2 (Date: Sep 30, 2021)
----------------------------------

- **Bug Fix:** Fixed incorrect precision calculation in ``class_recall.csv`` when multiple classes were present.

Version 1.1.1 (Date: Sep 14, 2021)
----------------------------------

- **Update:** ``project_boxes`` now includes output options for both ``predict_tile`` and ``predict_image``.
- **New Feature:** Introduced ``annotations_to_shapefile``, which reverses ``shapefile_to_annotations`` functionality.
  Thanks to @sdtaylor for this contribution.

Version 1.1.0 (Date: Aug 5, 2021)
----------------------------------

1. **Enhancement:** Empty frames are now allowed by passing annotations with 0's for all coordinates. Example format:
   ::

     image_path, 0, 0, 0, 0, "Tree"

2. **New Feature:** Introduced ``check_release`` to reduce GitHub rate limit issues. When using ``use_release()``, the local model will be used if ``check_release = False``.

Version 1.0.9 (Date: Jul 14, 2021)
----------------------------------

- **Enhancement:** Improved default dtype for Windows users, thanks to @ElliotSalisbury for the contribution.

Version 1.0.0 (Date: Jun 7, 2021)
----------------------------------

- **Major Update:** Transitioned from TensorFlow to a PyTorch backend, enhancing performance and flexibility.

Version 0.1.34 (Date: )
-----------------------

- **Optimization:** Profiled dataset and evaluation code, significantly improving evaluation performance.

Version 0.1.30 (Date: )
-----------------------

- **Bug Fix:** Resolved issues to allow learning rate monitoring and decay based on ``val_classification_loss``.
